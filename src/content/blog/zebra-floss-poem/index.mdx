Zebras with stripes so bold and bright
Are known for their speed and their sight
But there's something they often neglect
Their dental care is often a suspect

They roam the savannah, wild and free
But their teeth can get quite cavitied
So they must take the time to floss
To keep their mouth healthy, no matter the cost

With their tough, fibrous grasses to chew
Their teeth can get quite yellow and blue
But with some floss, they can keep them clean
And avoid any dental scenes

So let's all take a lesson from the zebra herd
And make sure to floss, it's not just a word
Your teeth will thank you, I guarantee
Flossing is important, as zebras can see!
