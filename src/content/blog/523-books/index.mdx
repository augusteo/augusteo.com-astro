I started tracking my book reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4577855-victor) around 2009. Since then, I’ve read an average of 52 books per year.

One of my resolution in 2012 was to read more books, and I somehow was able to keep it up until now. I’ve no idea how.

Drilling more in-depth into the months, you can see that each month was different. The most were Oct 2012 and March 2018, in which I managed to read 17 books. Some months were either one, or no book read at all.

**What does it all mean?**

In my experience, you should just read when you can. There will be times when you are too busy or too into this game or that tv show, and that’s fine. Some breaks are good to recharge the fun of reading.

If you don’t like reading, that’s fine too. Don’t let anyone pressure you into doing something you don’t enjoy. However, you might just haven’t found your kind of books that will keep you coming back.
