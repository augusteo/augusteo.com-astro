Having been a fan of both John and Hank Green for years, I was excited to dive into Hank's debut novel. As a longtime follower of their work, I couldn't pass up the chance to see how Hank's storytelling would translate to fiction. Spoiler alert: he doesn't disappoint!

## What I Loved About This Book

This book is **captivating**. Like, seriously captivating. I finished it in 2-3 days because I simply couldn't put it down. While reading, I experienced a whole range of emotions—from anger at the characters to wonder about the dream sequences and puzzles—but *boredom was never one of them*. I was constantly pulled forward, always wanting to know what would happen next.

This quote perfectly captures one of the book's central themes, and it stuck with me long after finishing the last page.

## What's It About? (Major Spoilers Ahead!)

The story follows April May, who stumbles upon a giant robot statue in New York City one night. In my mind, I pictured it like a Gundam just standing there in the middle of Manhattan. April and her friend Andy decide to film it, and their video goes viral overnight.

Here's where it gets interesting: identical statues (called "Carls") have appeared simultaneously in major cities worldwide. These aren't just ordinary statues—they're made of unknown materials, impervious to damage, and they actually *float*. Physics doesn't apply to them the way it does to everything else on Earth.

As the world reacts to these mysterious appearances, people become divided on whether the Carls are a force for good or evil. Are they just observing us? Or are they planning to take over Earth?

## The Dream Sequences: A Brilliant Plot Device

One of the most fascinating elements is how the Carls give everyone the same dream where they can lucid dream and work together to solve complex puzzles. These puzzles are deliberately designed to be cooperative—impossible to solve alone. They require diverse knowledge ranging from esoteric languages to obscure musical instruments and aviation engineering.

April theorizes that the Carls are testing humanity's ability to collaborate, which adds an intriguing layer to the story.

## Characters That Feel Real

While April is our protagonist, I particularly appreciated **Maya**, her ex-girlfriend. Unlike other characters who often felt like sidekicks just helping April without question, Maya holds her own ground and tells it like it is. She's not afraid to challenge April's decisions and provides a necessary counterbalance to April's increasingly fame-driven choices.

Other key relationships in the book include:

- **Robin**, April's assistant
- **Miranda**, a scientist who reaches out for help with the puzzles
- **Andy**, her friend who helps create the initial viral video

## Fame, Social Media, and Our Modern World

The book delves deeply into how fame changes people, and it feels eerily relevant. We watch as April becomes addicted to her Twitter followers, talk show invitations, and public adoration. Her transformation from normal person to celebrity spokesperson for the Carls happens at breakneck speed, showing how *quickly* power can indeed corrupt.

There's also a powerful exploration of xenophobia and fear-mongering through characters like Peter Petrawicki, who writes a book called "Invaded" arguing that the Carls are dangerous. This aspect feels very reminiscent of real-world politics, where fear is peddled to gain power and popularity—a rather Trumpian tactic that the book critiques effectively.

## The Climactic Ending

One of the most memorable moments comes near the end when April is trapped in a burning warehouse. The scene where she breaks through a window only to be crushed by a falling beam is heartbreaking—but then the twist comes when we learn she's somehow been transported into the Dream where she can speak directly with Carl. The revelation that Carl specifically chose her for first contact adds a whole new dimension to the story.

## Final Thoughts

While I wouldn't call it a perfect 5-star book that I'll repeatedly return to, "An Absolutely Remarkable Thing" is definitely a solid 4-star read that I thoroughly enjoyed. The cliffhanger ending with April's cryptic "Knock Knock" text message has me eager to pick up the sequel, "A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor."

If you enjoy science fiction with a contemporary twist, explorations of social media fame, and mysteries that unfold in unexpected ways, this book is absolutely worth your time.
