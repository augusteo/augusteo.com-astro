Since I published my [previous blog post](https://hugo.augusteo.com/blog/im-starting-a-charity-to-help-underprivileged-children-in-borneo-indonesia-to-get-quality-education.-heres-why-and-how-you-can-help./) two weeks ago, we have made significant progress. I am grateful for all the help and interest from all of you!

## **KPI**

Total children helped: **8**

## Updates

**1. We had paid for the tuition fee for two children this semester**

The children can now continue their education with one less worry. They are both covered until finishing high-school (at least).

**2. Generous donors had pledged to sponsor six more children**

The donations come from donors in Indonesia, Australia, and the USA. Thanks for all the pledges!

Some pledged to sponsor for a semester, some for a year, and some until the children finished with high-school.

**3. Handful of donors are happy to donate and let us decide where to spend it**

We are very grateful for your trust!

**4. We have registered borneoeducationfoundation.org domain name**

This name reflects our focus to help children in Borneo to get a good education.

**5. We now have a web developer on board to help make the website**

My high-school classmate, [**Wendy**](https://wend.web.id/), had volunteered to develop the website.

A very early alpha version is in the works. Wendy wrote it in PHP with CodeIgniter.

## Next Steps

**1. Registering 501©(3) organization**

My immigration lawyers have just confirmed that I can register a charitable organization despite my visa status. They just wanted to make sure that I won’t be compensated in any way. This won’t be a problem since all the money raised will go to the children.

If you know people who know how to do this best, please contact me!

**2. Expanding partnership with other schools in Borneo**

Right now, we are working with one school group only (Santu Petrus in Pontianak). We are planning to reach out to other schools to help more students.

**3. Recruit more volunteers to help and raise more money!**

Things are starting to heat up, and we will need more help. If you wanted to get involved, please [contact me](mailto:victor@augusteo.com).
