This article is a companion to a tech talk I’m giving to Monta Vista Highschool Entrehack event.

[Click here](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0_dTyQ0TkhTe-KxGGFXhJLHzw#MontaVistaHackathon_techtalk) for the Keynote presentation, and be sure to click ‘show presenter note’ on top left for my notes.

These links are a rough guide to help you get started with your hackathon project. Use them wisely.

The key is to focus on the vision and fleshing out your ideas during the hackathon and not to spend time dealing with app architecture and boilerplates.

Read this if your goal is to win. Otherwise, you can skip to the next section.

## Tech links

**Prototyping**

Sometimes you could do really well with just prototyping the user experience without doing any coding. [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) is a really good service to try this. If you prefer a native Mac app, I highly recommend [Flinto](https://www.flinto.com/).

**Web Builder**

If you only need simple websites and prefer drag and drop, [Wix.com](https://www.wix.com/) & [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) works really well.

**Infrastructure**

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is the easiest to get started if you need to store data like user accounts, pictures, database, etc. For more complex infrastructure, use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [MS Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

**Web Boilerplates**

[This project](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) is a very popular web boilerplate that has a lot of services baked in. Easy to get started too. It also have a bunch of recommended libraries/links for you to use.

Some other boilerplates if you prefer [React.js](https://www.reactboilerplate.com/) or [Rails](http://seed.happyfuncorp.com/).

**Cross Platform (Electron)**

If you really need to build apps for all platform, you should use [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

**iOS**

iOS is pretty easy to get started, but [this awesome page](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios) helps to find projects that you can reuse.

**Explore**

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular source control website and you should use it to search for projects to clone or to learn from.

You should also checkout this [mother of awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) to find out other awesome lists.

**Machine Learning**

Adding machine learning capabilities are actually really easy with these pre-trained models and services. Use [CoreML Models](https://github.com/likedan/Awesome-CoreML-Models) if you are building for iOS. You can also try [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?nc2=h_m1) or other ML services for web and mobile apps.

**SMS**

If you want to play around with SMS sending/receiving, you should try [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).
