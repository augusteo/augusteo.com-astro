I've been using Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) for about a month now, and I’ve taken every possible opportunity to test it out. Overall, I really like it—I'd say it does what it needs to do about **95% of the time**. But, of course, the devil is in the details.

So let’s break this down into three parts: **the good, the bad, and the things that make me go "huh?"**

---

## 🚀 The Good: It’s (Mostly) Like Magic

The best way I can describe FSD right now is that it’s **good enough to use daily without much hesitation**. For instance, I can drive from my home in **San Jose to my office in San Mateo**—a commute that ranges from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours—**without touching the steering wheel 95% of the time**.

That’s the key part: *"hands-off 95% of the time."* It’s not perfect, but it's really, really close.

Using FSD is simple:

1. Get in the car.
2. Set your destination.
3. Hold down the FSD button.
4. Let it drive.

Tesla offers **three driving modes**:

- **Chill Mode** – Supposed to be the smoothest and most relaxed.
- **Standard Mode** – A balance between caution and efficiency.
- **Hurry Mode** – More aggressive, takes tighter gaps, follows cars more closely.

I mostly use **Hurry Mode**, occasionally switching to Standard if it feels too reckless. I haven't really tried Chill Mode much, but maybe I should.

## 🤔 The Bad: When It Just Doesn’t Get It

While FSD is impressive, it still has some *"what the heck was that?"* moments. Here are the biggest issues I’ve run into:

### 1️⃣ Lane Selection Mistakes

One of the more common mistakes happens near my office. When turning right onto a street with multiple lanes, FSD **sometimes picks the wrong one**—choosing the rightmost lane, even when it’s a right-turn-only lane. Since I actually need to go straight, I have to take over at that moment. *Not a huge deal, but annoying.*

### 2️⃣ The Time It Almost Ran a Red Light

This happened **once**, but it was unsettling. I was waiting to turn left at a red arrow, and before the light changed, the car **started creeping forward** like it wanted to go. I had to hit the brakes.

It hasn’t happened again, but this is exactly why you **still have to pay attention.** You never really know when FSD might do something unexpected.

### 3️⃣ It Doesn’t See Objects Super Close to the Car

This is an issue when parking. My driveway has a curb and a slope leading to the street. The car **doesn’t recognize the curb** because it’s too close to the front cameras, so if I start FSD from a parked position, it will just **drive straight over the curb**.

Now, I **always manually drive over the slope first**, then enable FSD.

### 4️⃣ Yellow Light Aggression

Sometimes FSD is a little *too* eager to **beat a yellow light** instead of stopping. I suspect this is because I usually have it on Hurry Mode, but even when I switch to Standard, it still tries to push through more often than I’d like.

### 5️⃣ Randomly Driving in the Express Lane

Even when I don’t want to use the express lane (because, you know, **tolls**), FSD **sometimes moves into it anyway**. Switching to Standard Mode usually makes it return to a normal lane, but not always. When it refuses to leave the express lane, I have to take over and manually correct it.

## 🧐 The Quirks: Tesla’s Attempts to Keep You Engaged

Tesla **really wants you to pay attention** when using FSD, and I’ve tested the limits of how it enforces this.

### 1️⃣ Video Calls? Nope.

I once tried to take a **work video call** while driving, and Tesla immediately knew I was **looking at my phone**. It gave me **two or three warnings**, then **disabled FSD completely** until I parked the car and restarted it. Lesson learned.

### 2️⃣ Closing My Eyes

I wanted to see if the car could tell if I wasn’t paying attention, so I tried **closing my eyes** while my wife watched the road. Surprisingly, it didn’t immediately freak out. I didn’t time it, but I could close my eyes for a little while before it started demanding attention.

### 3️⃣ Sunglasses Trick

Wearing **sunglasses** seems to confuse the system a bit. Since the car can’t track my eyes, it doesn’t warn me about inattention as much. Instead, it compensates by **periodically asking me to wiggle the steering wheel**.

So theoretically—**not saying you should do this**—but if someone wanted to watch a video while using FSD, they could wear sunglasses and just shake the wheel when prompted. *(Again, I am not recommending this. Just… you know… as an engineer, I was curious.)*

## 🎯 Final Thoughts: Worth It?

Despite its flaws, **I love Tesla’s FSD.** It has exceeded my expectations, and I plan to keep paying for it.

My wife? **Not convinced.** She doesn’t fully trust it, and given the occasional weird behavior, I can’t blame her. But for me, **FSD makes commuting effortless.** I don’t worry about directions, I don’t stress over traffic—I just turn it on, play a podcast or audiobook, and relax.

It genuinely feels like **living in the future**. And I’m here for it.
