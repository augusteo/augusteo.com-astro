NFTs are cryptocurrency tokens that represent the ownership in a digital asset. Like all digital assets, NFTs can be sent across the world immediately and require little to no physical storage. But unlike other digital assets, they are unique, cannot be duplicated, and can only be transferred by their owners. That’s why they’re used to represent ownership of digital assets.

Microdosing involves taking a low dose of a psychedelic drug to enhance performance, or reduce stress and anxiety. The 24 participants experienced personality changes after a period of microdosing. They found a decrease in neuroticism and an increase in conscientiousness (people who are highly conscientious tend to be diligent, for example). Interestingly, a greater amount of experience with microdosing was associated with lower levels of neuroticism among the 76 participants.

The author of the article found that the book consistently overstates the problem of lack of sleep, sometimes egregiously so. It misrepresents basic sleep research and contradicts its own sources.

It’s pretty much impossible to stop companies from collecting data about you — even if you don’t use their services, they still have their ways. But you can at least limit how algorithms use it against you. There are also more private browsers to limit data collection and prevent sites from linking you to your past visits or data. Or you can just stop using those services entirely.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital adoption, especially in grocery shopping and healthcare, and this is expected to continue. Second, the pandemic and lockdowns reversed the long-standing trend of declining money and time spent at home, leading to “home nesting.” We expect this behavior to stick as some portion of high-income households will prefer to work from home to some degree after the pandemic and low-income households retain low-cost at-home alternatives such as digital entertainment.

Most people who are rich chose their parents wisely.
