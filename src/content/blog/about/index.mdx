Hello, my name is Victor. I’m a software engineer by trade.

I [enjoy reading all kinds of books](https://www.augusteo.com/523-books) and tracked them on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4577855-victor).

My other interests include martial arts, rock climbing, stoicism, meditation, AI/ML and playing with my kids.

## **Short Story**

I was born in a small town in Borneo, Indonesia. I frequently move around throughout my teenage years to pursue educations at different places. I then traveled to Melbourne, Australia to continue higher education.

Some time ago, [Apple offered to relocate](https://www.augusteo.com/experience-moving-aussie-to-sv) my family to Silicon Valley to join them. I have been living here since and enjoying it - a whole new world to explore.

## **Contact**

The best way to get in touch with me is through email: [mailto:victor@augusteo.com](mailto:victor@augusteo.com)

I generally reply within twenty-four hours.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
