I’ve been having Soylent lunch for approximately five years. I drank it every working day at lunch break. It is quick, nutritious, filling, and require very little preparation and clean up. Perfect for a lazy person like myself.

Think of these prep steps as the culmination of my five years of experience in consuming Soylent optimally.

**Hardware needed**: Blender with 24oz bottle. I use the [Ninja brand](https://smile.amazon.com/Ninja-Personal-Smoothies-24-Ounce-BL480D/dp/B01N7Y3H73/) and love it.

**Summary**

1. Fill the bottle with a little bit of water
2. Put two scoops of Soylent
3. Add whatever supplements you desire
4. Add chunky-cut fruits. I usually use Apples and Pears
5. Add soy milk or dairy milk if you are lactose tolerant.
6. Blend them
7. Drink
8. Clean up

Approximate time required: ~5 minutes.

**Photos and details**

1. **Fill the bottle with a little bit of water.** I usually run the tap for 1-2 seconds. This step is necessary so that the powders don’t stick to the container during blending.

2. **Put two scoops of Soylent.**
 I find that this is enough to sate me. Add more or less as necessary for you.

3. **Add whatever supplements you desire.**
 I added Creatine Monohydrate here. Feel free to add whatever supplement you take.

4. **Add chunky-cut fruits. I usually use Apples and Pears.**
 You should de-core the fruits, then quarter them and cut them a little smaller to help with the blending.

5. **Add soy milk or dairy milk if you are lactose tolerant.**
 Fill it up! Usually, I went way over the “MAX FILL” line, but it still works fine.

6. **Blend them for 30 seconds.

After drinking, you need to rinse them off with water to prevent sticking. Then just put the dirty container into the dishwasher or wash manually.
