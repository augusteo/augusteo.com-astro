I've been driving my 2015 Nissan Leaf for years, but recently it's become clear that I need a replacement. The battery degradation has reached a point where I can't even reliably commute to work anymore. While it supposedly has 65 miles of range, this drops to around 55 miles on the freeway. My 30-mile commute to work eats up about 60% of the battery, and I've developed constant range anxiety about the car dying on me mid-journey.

## The Search Process

I decided to look for a used electric car since I've already experienced the steep depreciation of buying new and didn't want to repeat that experience. My search began with opening multiple tabs across various websites like Edmunds, CarMax and Carvana, focusing on specific criteria:

- Model year 2023 or newer, as I wanted something relatively recent
- Traffic-aware cruise control - a feature my Nissan Leaf lacked that I really wanted
- Sufficient cargo space to accommodate my family of four and our travel needs

## Making an Objective Comparison

I created a comparison table of different EV options, looking at factors like price, cargo space, and range. Interestingly, this process led me to an unexpected conclusion. Despite my initial skepticism about Tesla due to concerns about build quality and what I perceived as poor value for money, the data told a different story. The used Tesla Model Y emerged as the clear winner, offering:

- The highest range in its price bracket
- Competitive pricing (alternatives were about $10,000 more expensive)
- Sufficient cargo space for our needs
- I found one with only 2,000 miles - practically new

## The Remote Purchase Experience

I ventured into new territory by deciding to purchase the car from Southern California without seeing it in person. The process involved:

- A remote inspection where the dealer sent video recordings of the exterior and interior
- Multiple rounds of questions about the vehicle's condition
- A straightforward purchase process: wire the money, wait about a week for it to clear
- Transport arrangement that took a couple of days
- Delivery right to my door via a car carrier at 8 AM as scheduled

## The Result

I've been thoroughly enjoying the Tesla Model Y. The improved range and new technology have been great additions to my driving experience. While I haven't tried supercharging yet, I've been experimenting with the Full Self-Driving feature. It's impressive, though it does have some drawbacks that I'll save for another blog post.
