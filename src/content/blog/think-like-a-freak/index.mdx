6. Do you believe you can persuade someone who doesn’t want to be persuaded? Think about someone who holds a different opinion than you about politics, the environment, taxes, or any other issue. What approach would you use to try to change his or her viewpoint?

7. Effectively using incentives means understanding what they are. Can you give some examples of financial, social, moral, legal or other kinds of incentives and describe how they might work in one setting and backfire in another.

8. This book introduces the concepts of declared preferences and revealed preferences. Explain the difference between these and offer examples of these two types of preferences that you have observed in your own experience.

9. Why do the authors advise a would-be persuader to steer clear of anecdotes? Do you agree with them? What is the problem with anecdotes?
