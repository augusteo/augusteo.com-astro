As a bonus, this will also enable searching on Samba too.

### Problem

I have a external HDD plugged into a Raspi which acts as a seed box of some kind. The files are served with Samba. The problem was:

- Listing large amount of file in a directory takes ages.
- Search doesn’t work at all, it just got stuck at “Searching”.
- Transfer speed was very slow.

### Solution

After much searching, the fix is quite simple actually.

First, SSH into the server with `$ ssh serverIp`

Then edit the Samba config by typing `$ vim /etc/samba/smb.conf`

Once it is open add these lines to your particularly slow Samba shares:

```
vfs objects = fruit
fruit:aapl = yes
fruit:encoding = native
fruit:locking = none
fruit:metadata = stream
fruit:resource = file

```

Lastly restart the server with `$sudo service smbd restart`

### Result

Now the listing large directory should be pretty fast, search should work as normal and transfer speed should be around 10x faster.
