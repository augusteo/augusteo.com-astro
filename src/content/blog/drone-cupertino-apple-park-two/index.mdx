Second flight from Cupertino (Hamptons). This flight might be the last since there’s only so much you could shoot from here. Next Cupertino flight would probably be from Infinite Loop campus.

I enjoyed experimenting with the top-down drone style shoots and trying out different elevation and angles. The dynamism is a significant improvement over the traditional camera - which was limited by your feet.

However, I would love to have the dynamic range of SLR and better camera control on the drone. Even with five bracketed shot, you probably only get the same dynamic range as a single full-frame SLR RAW. I await the day that we can have a full-frame drone camera.
